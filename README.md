### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student with a background in machine learning, deeply passionate about exploring diverse fields of knowledge. While my heart lies in AI technology and its applications, I also actively engage in front-end development projects.

Driven by curiosity, I consider myself a self-motivated developer, always eager to learn and build meaningful tools that bridge the gap between people and technology.

I'm currently the maintainer of Cherry Studio, an open-source project focused on comprehensive applications of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).

If you're interested in AI, web development, or just want to chat about cool tech stuff â€” feel free to reach out!
