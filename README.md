### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student with a background in machine learning, and I'm passionate about exploring diverse fields of knowledge. While I primarily focus on front-end development, I also have experience working on the back-end, building full-stack applications that are both powerful and user-friendly.

Driven by curiosity, I consider myself a self-motivated developer, always eager to learn and build meaningful tools that bridge the gap between people and technology.

I'm currently the maintainer of Cherry Studio, an open-source project focused on comprehensive applications of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).

If you're interested in AI, web development, or just want to chat about cool tech stuff â€” feel free to reach out!
